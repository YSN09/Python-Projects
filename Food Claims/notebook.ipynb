The columns were then converted to a categorical format to satisfy the nominal condition. The column contained unique values and did not possess any null values.\n\n**time_to_close**: The column contained discrete values. All the values in the column are positive. There were 256 unique values ranging from 76 to 518. There were no missing values, so no changes were made to the column.\n\n**Claim_amount**: The column was in the object format.The column possesed values in the wrong format. The string value currency denomination was removed from the column and all the values in the column were converted to float and rounded to 2 digits. Therefore converting into a float format satisfied the continuous variable format. There were 2000 unique values and no null values.\n\n**amount_paid**: The column contained continuous values. The column comprises 1963 unique values ranging from 1516.72 to 52498.75. However, the column possessed 36 null values, later replaced with the median amount from the amount_paid column.\n\n**location**: The column possesses 4 unique values. The column satisfied the nominal variable condition. The column possessed no null values, so no changes were made.\n\n**individuals_on_claim**: The column contained discrete values. The column comprises 15 unique values ranging from 1 to 15. The minimum person is 1 in the column. There were no null values, so no changes were made to the column.\n\n**linked_cases**: The column contained nominal values. The column contained 26 null values, which were replaced with the 'False' value.\n\n**Cause**: The column contained nominal values. The column had 5 unique values as opposed to the 3 values. This was due to the wrong format of the letters. As 'meat' and 'Meat' were treated as separate values. All the mis-formated words were replaced and corrected. The column did not have any null values.","metadata":{"tags":[]},"id":"714a7083-7a43-4b0b-8ed4-2675efc87691","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Task 2","metadata":{},"id":"643d4c36-4183-4fbe-a263-6b9de60d29da","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"Create a visualization that shows the number of claims in each location.
