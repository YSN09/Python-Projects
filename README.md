# Coin Flip
The Coin Flip Distribution Analysis project explores whether the outcome of flipping a fair coin follows a normal distribution. It includes a simulation of coin flips and visualization of data. By examining the distribution and comparing it to a normal distribution, the project aims to enhance understanding of the statistical behavior of coin flipping.

# Empire State Problem 
What is the probability of successfully reaching step 60 in the Empire State Building by rolling the dice 100 times, taking into account the following rules:
If the dice shows 1 or 2, you go down by 1 step.
If the dice shows 3, 4, or 5, you climb up by 1 step.
If the dice shows 6, you roll the dice again and climb up by the number of steps shown.
You cannot go below step 0.
Additionally, there is a 0.1% chance of falling down the stairs and reaching step 0.
