# Coin Flip
The Coin Flip Distribution Analysis project explores whether the outcome of flipping a fair coin follows a normal distribution. It includes a simulation of coin flips and visualization of data. By examining the distribution and comparing it to a normal distribution, the project aims to enhance understanding of the statistical behavior of coin flipping.
